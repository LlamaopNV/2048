# 2048 Game - Recreation and Playground

This repository contains a recreation of the popular game 2048. Please note that I do not own the game 2048; this is a simple, self-made version created solely for the purpose of exploring algorithmic solutions and serving as a test playground for experimentation.

## About the Game

The game mimics the mechanics of the original 2048:
- Arrow key controls to move tiles.
- Tiles merge when they collide, doubling in value.
- The goal is to create the 2048 tile or achieve the highest score possible.

Additional features:
- A score tracker that updates with every move and shows point increments briefly.
- A text window logging each move made, including "Invalid Move" notifications for moves with no effect.
- Reset button to restart the game.

## Purpose

The main aim of this project is to serve as a playground to test and refine an algorithm capable of consistently solving the 2048 game. The codebase is intended for experimentation and educational purposes.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have `pygame` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame


## Update
Added the self solving function I was thinkng about but it fails to perform as intended, will expand on this
